In this project, the pyBN library was used to work with Bayesian networks (author Nicholas Cullen <ncullen.th@dartmouth.edu>)


Link to the repository with the library:https://github.com/ncullen93/pyBN

Our Bayesian block hierarchical learning code is in the folder "block_learning".  

Functionality of the developed code:   

save_bn.py - Function for saving a trained model to a json. file  

read_bn.py - Function for reading a trained model from a json. file  

train_bn.py - Function for trainig the structure and parameters of BN from data.  

partial_bn_train.py - Function for adding new BN and trainig new connected BN with hidden vars.  

sampling.py - Function for generating synthetic data from BN model.
